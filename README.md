# Image-Classification-using-R

Dataset was taken from keggle "https://www.kaggle.com/slothkong/10-monkey-species"

Content:
The dataset consists of two files, training and validation. Each folder contains 10 subforders labeled as n0~n9, each corresponding a species form Wikipedia's monkey cladogram. Images are 400x300 px or larger and JPEG format (almost 1400 images). Images were downloaded with help of the googliser open source code.

But here I did classification between only two species

Label mapping:
n0, alouatta_palliata
n1, erythrocebus_patas

Aim:
This dataset is intended as a test case for fine-grain classification tasks, perhaps best used in combination with transfer learning. Hopefully someone can help us expand the number of classes or number of images.
